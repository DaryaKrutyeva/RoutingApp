# RoutingApp
Data Structures and Algorithms
The purpose for this application was to apply the algorithms and data structures studied to solve a real programming problem. 

The goal for this application is to complete all 
deliveries in under 140 miles, using three trucks and two drivers. Certain constraints will apply to the packages, such as truck preferences, delayed package, wrong address information, deadlines, and 
packages that must be delivered together.


As this is a variation of the Traveling Salesman Problem, I 
found it fitting to use the Greedy Algorithm, which works by determining the shortest path in between 
each package one at a time (hence Greedy). While this didn't provide me with the optimal solution, it was efficient and satisfactory. 

Please refer to attached PDF for the big O breakdown.
